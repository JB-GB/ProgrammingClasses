# ProgrammingClasses
Activities done at uni classes
---
I'm attending classes at uni. Advanced Programming is one of them. We are going to use python.
The thing is... how advanced level are we actually going to reach? We are 9 enrolled students in the class and most of them never used python (or any programming lang at all). 

Anyway, at least I want to help them in any way possible. Because, if they can count with a place to recall the previous classes, maybe the teacher will go a bit faster. Which is good for me and my ambitions.

Also, I'm hoping we all pass flawlessly.
